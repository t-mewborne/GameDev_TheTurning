# GameDev_TheTurning
You wake up in your home next to a bottle of pills, wearing a hospital bracelet. Your memory is foggy. Your child is severly ill and unresponsive. You set out to the hospital name from your bracelet to find a cure. As time progresses, you get sicker and sicker. Taking the pills you found temporarily alleviates the turning. It's your job to solve mysteries, find the cure, and escapte the hospital before it is too late.

The turning is a thrilling tilemap game. The object of the game is to find the cure and escape the hospital. The player must gather ingredients to find the cure. The ingrediants are placed around the map. Each ingredient has a unique puzzle required for completion in order to obtain it. Once all ingredients are found, the player can make their way to the labratory bench to put them all together for a final vaccine.
